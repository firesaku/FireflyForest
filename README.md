The Firefly Forest algorithm is a novel bio-inspired clustering method designed to address key challenges in traditional clustering techniques, such as the need to set a fixed number of neighbors, predefine cluster numbers, and rely on computationally intensive swarm iterative processes. The algorithm begins by using an adaptive neighbor estimation, refined to filter outliers, to determine the brightness of each firefly. This brightness guides the formation of firefly trees, which are then merged into cohesive firefly forests, completing the clustering process. This approach allows the algorithm to dynamically capture both local and global patterns, eliminate the need for predefined cluster numbers, and operate with low computational complexity. Experiments involving 14 established clustering algorithms across 19 diverse datasets, using 8 evaluative metrics, demonstrate the Firefly Forest algorithmâ€™s superior accuracy and robustness. These results highlight its potential as a powerful tool for real-world clustering applications.
